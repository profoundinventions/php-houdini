PHP Houdini lets you add autocompletion for classes with magic methods, like ``__call()``,
``__get()``, and ``__set()``.

The plugin allows you to control completion
flexibly by specifying how to complete properties and methods through a configuration
file written in PHP.

.. note::
    If the plugin is missing anything you think is essential, please let
    us know! We definitely are eager to hear from you. You can reach us at
    at ``support@profoundinventions.com``

Read :doc:`the next step <the-houdini-config-file>` to learn more about how to configure
the plugin.
